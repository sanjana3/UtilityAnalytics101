# Day 2 Notes


1. Begin with slides
  - Data preparation slides include notes about data preparation: ingestion, exploration, and preparation. Most of this information is from the text R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham), available here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/. 
  - SQL/SQL databases: most of this information (and some of the examples I use) comes from two texts, Getting Started with SQL (uses SQLite for hands-on exercises), and Practical SQL (uses Postgres). As far as I know, these texts are not available for free. However, there are many resources for learning/teaching SQL. 


2. I typically alternate between slides and hands-on SQL exercises, which keeps students engaged. My SQL examples are included. You might not have time to go through every query, so you can select the most appropriate ones based on how the class is going.


3. Improvement: 
  - As I mentioned in the day 1 notes, the exploration section might be combined with the data visualization section since there is quite a bit of redundancy between the two. You could also potentially go deeper into the statistical exploration methods, e.g. correlation analysis, linear regression, etc. Note that the the SQL section typically takes the majority of the available time on day 2. 
  - I don't have any specific recommendations here, but the SQL slides can surely be improved also.


4. Exercises: I alternate between the two databases, weather_stations.db (from Getting Started with SQL; Neild) and cps_energy.db (data provided by CPS Energy). The datasets are available at GitHub: https://github.com/blcrow/ua101.
